    Theorems, proofs, definitions, etc.  can easily be defined
    \begin{theorem}
        \label{thm:first}
        Definite integral of a function is related to its antiderivative, 
        and can be reversed by differentiation.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        \label{prf:first}
        If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, 
            then $\int_a^b f$ exists. \\
        If $f$ is continous on $[a, b]$ and $c \in [a, b]$, 
            then $\int_a^c F + \int_c^b F = \int_a^b F$. \\
        If $m \leq f \leq M$ on $[a, b]$, 
            then $(b - a)m \leq \int_a^b f \leq (b - a)M$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{definition}
        \label{def:first}
        Calcuus is the branch of mathematics that deals with the 
        finding and properties of derivatives and integrals of 
        functions, by methods originally based on the summation 
        of infinitesimal differences. The two main types are 
        differential calculus and integral calculus.
